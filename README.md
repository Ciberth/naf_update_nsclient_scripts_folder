# Nagios XI Automatisation Framework

### Idea

Framework for installation of software on Windows servers from Nagios XI. For now with quick actions linked to a bash script that 
will request installation from a Windows gateway server to the  Windows server where the software is needed. Hopefully later with 
a component and dashlet written by Troy Lea.

### Status

Under development. Confirmed to work on Windows 2003, 2003 R2, 2008 and 2008 R2. 

### How to contribute

First, building, testing and reporting bugs are highly appreciated. Please include console's output and reproduction step in your bug report.
